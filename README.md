# BullyBlock

An application that helps create a more safe environment for children and reduce any worry that the students and parents have about bullying in schools. 
We built this app with Github Copilot and python and tested the app on Visual Studio code using Jupyter notebook.

## Project Status

The app is fully complete, we are expecting to make changes and turn it into a downloadable app in iOS and Android.
